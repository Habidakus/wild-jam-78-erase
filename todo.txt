- Re-evaluate how armor works
- add Shops & Chests to the overland map
- Add a mimic
- add UI & attack sounds
- Add better monster & hero attack "animations"

Known Bugs:

- player can have both net and potion, both are single use (which doesn't work with our optimization)
- Why are we offered a chance to drink a potion when not hurt?
- Go Now should not be able to be cast on self
- Resurrection didn't heal the turn it was learned

Future work:
