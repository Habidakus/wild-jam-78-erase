- Add more hero skills

Known Bugs:

- clean up the paths each time you pass the Chronotyrant (currently your previous path is still lit the second time through)
- healing prayer should bring back to live those currently dead when you get it, rather then after the next fight
- shouldn't give magic shield to the dead
- player can have both net and potion, both are single use (which doesn't work with our optimization)
