- Credits page
- Re-evaluate how armor works
- add Shops & Chests to the overland map
- Add a mimic
- Rather than always random heroes, have Initial hero crafting by the player (select race, occupation, extra gear)
- add UI & attack sounds
- Replace targeting lines with nice looking particles
- Add monster & hero attack "animations"

Known Bugs:

- player can have both net and potion, both are single use (which doesn't work with our optimization)
- Why are we offered a chance to drink a potion when not hurt?
