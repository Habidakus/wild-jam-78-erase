- Add slimes as enemies
- Re-evaluate how armor works
- add Shops & Chests to the overland map

Known Bugs:

- player can have both net and potion, both are single use (which doesn't work with our optimization)
- Why are we offered a chance to drink a potion when not hurt?
- Sometimes heroes offered level 2 skill when they don't have the level 1 skill
