- Re-evaluate how armor works
- add Shops & Chests to the overland map
- Add a mimic
- Rather than always random heroes, have Initial hero crafting by the player (select race, occupation, extra gear)
- add UI & attack sounds
- Add monster & hero attack "animations"

Known Bugs:

- player can have both net and potion, both are single use (which doesn't work with our optimization)
- Why are we offered a chance to drink a potion when not hurt?
- Go Now should not be able to be cast on self
- Resurrection didn't heal the turn it was learned

Future work:

- Add the "Guard" ability to knights
- better graphics on the path screen
